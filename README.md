# govuk-entity-personalisation

## Overview

Using entities on GOV.UK content to power personalisation

## Requirements

To run the code in this GitHub repository, please make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- Unix-like operating system (macOS, Linux, â€¦);
- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) installed, including shell hooks;
- [`.envrc`](.envrc) allowed/trusted by `direnv` to use the environment variables - see
[below](#allowingtrusting-envrc);
- Python 3.5 or above; and
- Python packages installed from the `requirements.txt` file.

Note there may be some Python IDE-specific requirements around loading environment variables, which are not considered
here.

### Allowing/trusting `.envrc`

To allow/trust the [`.envrc`](.envrc) run the `allow` command using `direnv` at the top level of this repository.

```shell script
direnv allow
```

> **Note:** If you're using PyCharm, then you will need to apply a few more steps before running `direnv allow` in your shell:
> - In your shell, run `pip install python-dotenv`.
> - On PyCharm, click `PyCharm` -> `Preferences` -> `Plugins` and download the `EnvFile` plugin.
> - On PyCharm, edit your configuration to `Enable EnvFile` by ticking the checkbox.
> - On PyCharm, click `PyCharm` -> `Preferences` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Console` -> `Python Console` and in the `Starting script` section, add the following Python code:
>    + `from dotenv import load_dotenv`
>    + `load_dotenv()`

### Installing Python packages

To install required Python packages via `pip`, first [set up a Python virtual
environment](#creating-a-python-virtual-environment); this ensures you do not install the packages globally.

Then run the following `make` command at the top level of this repository:

```shell script
make requirements
```

Once you have installed the packages, remember to [set up pre-commit hooks](#installing-pre-commit-hooks).

### Creating a Python virtual environment

Creating a Python virtual environment depends on whether you are using [base Python](#base-python-interpreter) or
[Anaconda](#anaconda-interpreter) as your interpreter.

#### Base Python interpreter

If you are using base Python, there are multiple ways to create virtual environments in Python using `pip`, including
(but not limited to):

- [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html);
- [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/);
- [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv); and
- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with its `virtualenv` [plugin](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

Follow the documentation of your chosen method to create a Python virtual environment.

#### Anaconda interpreter

If you are using [Anaconda or `conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/), following their
[documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to set up a
conda environment.

## Folder structure

An overview of the folder structure, and the top-level files can be found [here](docs/structure/README.md).

## Installing pre-commit hooks

This repo uses the Python package [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to manage pre-commit hooks. Pre-commit hooks
are actions which are run automatically, typically on each commit, to perform some common set of tasks. For example, a
pre-commit hook might be used to run any code linting automatically, providing any warnings before code is committed,
ensuring that all of our code adheres to a certain quality standard.

For this repo, we are using `pre-commit` for a number of purposes:
- Checking for any secrets being committed accidentally;
- Checking for any large files (over 5MB) being committed; and
- Cleaning Jupyter notebooks, which means removing all outputs and execution counts.

We have configured `pre-commit` to run automatically on _every commit_. By running on each commit, we ensure
that `pre-commit` will be able to detect all contraventions and keep our repo in a healthy state.

In order for `pre-commit` to run, action is needed to configure it on your system.

- [Install](#installing-python-packages) the `pre-commit` package into your Python environment; and
- Run `pre-commit install` to set-up `pre-commit` to run when code is _committed_.

### Setting up a baseline for the `detect-secrets` hook (if one doesn't already exist)

The `detect-secrets` hook requires that you generate a baseline file if one is not already present within the root
directory. This is done via running the following at the root of the repo:

```shell script
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline
```

Next, audit the baseline that has been generated by running:

```shell script
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```

When you run this command, you'll enter an interactive console and be presented with a list of high-entropy string /
anything which _could_ be a secret, and asked to verify whether or not this is the case. By doing this, the hook will
be in a position to know if you're later committing any _new_ secrets to the repo and it will be able to alert you
accordingly.

### If `pre-commit` detects secrets during commit:

If `pre-commit` detects any secrets when you try to create a commit, it will detail what it found and where to go to
check the secret.

If the detected secret is a false-positive, you should update the secrets baseline through the following steps:

- Run `detect-secrets scan --update .secrets.baseline` to index the false-positive(s);
- Next, audit all indexed secrets via `detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline` (the same as during initial set-up, if a
secrets baseline doesn't exist); and
- Finally, ensure that you commit the updated secrets baseline in the same commit as the false-positive(s) it has been
updated for.

If the detected secret is actually a secret (or other sensitive information), remove the secret and re-commit. There is
no need to update the secrets baseline in this case.

If your commit contains a mixture of false-positives and actual secrets, remove the actual secrets first before
updating and auditing the secrets baseline.

### Note on Jupyter notebook cleaning

It may be necessary or useful to keep certain output cells of a Jupyter notebook, for example charts or graphs
visualising some set of data. To do this, add the following comment at the top of the input block:

```shell script
# [keep_output]
```

This will tell `pre-commit` not to strip the resulting output of this cell, allowing it to be committed.
