    "# Search analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I wanted to answer the following questions, answers that I found are beneath each one\n",
    "\n",
    "Worth mentioning that the search data consists of 506,992 individual searches, all on the 10th/11th Nov 2020 - so might not be representative of wider trends but should be enough to make some high level inferences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What percentage of searches have nouns or verbs or both?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nouns and verbs: 111059 (24%)\n",
    "Just nouns: 305836 (68%)\n",
    "Just verbs: 33486 (7%)\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect the true number of verbs is lower as spacy can mislabel some words, eg \"fund\" can be a verb or noun, in the context of government its a noun and spacy could have mislabelled words like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, though, we can see that almost exactly 2/3 of searches consist entirely of nouns. This is interesting and makes intuitive sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Here be opinions\" -> the 'bad thing' though is that it could mean that users are making non specific, vague searches - from which it is hard to tell (even as a human) what they want. Eg if someone wants to sign in the their universal credit account and searches for \"universal credit\" then they might well get the right page but no search engine could correctly infer from the search term why that person wanted that page - other people searching for the same term could well want to apply or just get more information about it. Thus, to my mind, if we can increase the number of people making more specific searches then they would (likely) get better results and it would also be easier for us to improve search (as we'd have a better idea of user intent).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What percentage of searches have constrictively detected SVO triples?\n",
    "\n",
    "I've used a _very_ constrictive method of detecting SVO triples here (ie that it must follow good grammar rules etc.) which we can be pretty sure is a bad assumption. I deliberately shied away from assuming that a search like \"apply passport\" means that passport is the object and apply is the verb - even though it's a pretty reasonable assumption. This is because I wanted to see how well the approach of being sure that two words are related is. Thus, 16% of 1000 searches had a triple, in theory it could be as high as 24% (the percentage of searches with a verb and noun). This is higher than I initially thought\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What percentage of searches have entities in them?\n",
    "\n",
    "39%. I suspect that the true value is higher as govNER has been trained on GOV.UK content which has correct casings and thus it doesn't always detect entities in strings like \"universal credit\" or misspellings. A simple way to get around this is to try getting a list of all unique entities from the Knowledge Graph, lowercasing them and doing a simple string match or Levenstein distance (to account for typos)."
