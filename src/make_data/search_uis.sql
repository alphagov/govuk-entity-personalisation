/* GA Sessions x UIS */
-- Query to join user-intents-survey data to sessions data on BigQuery
-- Reference:
--  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-user-journey-models/blob/master/queries/joining_user-intent-data_big-query.sql
--  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-user-journey-models/blob/master/notebooks/LoadSmartSurveyData-finalform.ipynb
--
-- Notes:
--  The `clientID` field is the only field that is in common between BigQuery and the uis-data.
--  Upload uis-data to BQ using the following schema in the "Edit as text" format:
--  Started:STRING,Ended:STRING,Tracking_Link:STRING,Page_Path:STRING,clientID:STRING,Q1:STRING,Q4:STRING,Q5:STRING,target:STRING,respondent_id:INTEGER,full_url:STRING,page:STRING,section:STRING,org:STRING,Started_Date:STRING,Ended_Date:STRING,Started_Date_sub_12h:STRING

--  `clientID` is a floating point value up to 10 decimal places. BigQuery stores this value as a string. Worth noting that BigQuery has a technical limit where it can only process numbers that have decimal places up to 9 positions. Depending on how you've configured the table, a number of strategies could be employed:
--     + Multiply `clientID` by a multiple of 10, to reduce the number of decimal places.
--     + Cast as FLOAT64.
--     + Encode `clientID` as STRING. `clientID` is encoded as STRING in BQ.
--
--  `clientID` can be attached to multiple sessions, and each session can contain multiple events.
--  To support with finding the correct corresponding session on ga, we are filtering `eventCategory`, and `eventAction` for events related to completing a survey response.

-- Structure:
--  Code is in the following stages:
--      1. Stage One: For GA, un-nest hits to get info from each `pageview` and extract custom dimensions.
--      2. Stage Two: For GA, aggregate on `session_id` and `date` level.
--      3. Stage Three: For GA, when a session spans more than one day, aggregate over the whole session.
--      4. Stage Four: For GA and UIS, join GA data to user intents survey; get unique session_id:survey response pairs.
